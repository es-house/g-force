# g-force

G-Force is a 3D gravity flipping platformer prototypying.
The prototype explores different movement mechanics through physics-based player control and the ability of the player to invert the gravity.
It was designed as a prototype for my game design portfolio.

### ðŸŽ® Core Features

* Physics-Based Movement - The player can move around thanks to a smooth Rigidbody-based controls with velocity clamping to avoid the player to reach high speed
* Gravity Inversion Mechanic - The player can invert the gravity and move in the environment upside-down
* Cinemachine Camera - A camera that will follow the player
* Audio Feedbacks - When the player falls, run, land, or take the key and the goal, an SFX will be played
* VFX - When the player inverts the gravity a visual effect will be shown
* Clean Code - The project is developed in such a way to keep the code clean and to make every component to have a single responsibility

### ðŸ§  Purpose

The project is not a full game but a mechanic focused prototype that I create to:

* Demonstrate rapid gameplay system implementation
* Showcase player feel, feedback and interaction
* Strengthen my game design and technical portfolio
* Have fun while designing and developing it
* Keep myself busy during my holidays :)

### ðŸš€ Made With

* Unity 6 (version 6000.0.40f1)
* C#
* Cinemachine
* Unity Particle System
